## Overview

This repository contains a Manim scripts for visualizing signals.

[`sinesum.py`](./sinesum.py) - animation of two sine waves and their combined sum. The animation includes:

- **Visualization of two individual sine waves** (10 Hz and 5 Hz).
- **Dynamic transformation** showing how the two waves combine to form a sum wave.
- **LaTeX formula rendering** for the sum of the two sine waves.
- Forward and backward transformations to demonstrate how the sum wave is formed from the individual waves.
